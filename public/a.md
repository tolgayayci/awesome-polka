# PROJECT IN MOST 50 CHARACTERS

Discover and manage the most exciting projects on the Celo ecosystem with Awesome Celo!

# HOW DOES THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO CELO'S MISSION OF BUILDING AN OPEN FINANCIAL SYSTEM THAT CREATES THE CONDITIONS OF PROSPERITY FOR ALL?

I will answer this question with three important points, but the usage area is not limited to these.

Marketing and Promotion: Project owners can use this project as a marketing and promotion tool to raise awareness about their initiatives within the Celo ecosystem. By explaining their projects in detail and highlighting their unique features, they can attract more users and stakeholders, and ultimately increase their project's visibility and adoption.

Community Building: This project can be used to create a more informed and engaged community within the Celo ecosystem. By offering a centralized platform where project owners can explain their initiatives, community members can better understand the projects, provide feedback, and participate in discussions around the ecosystem's development.

Investor Research: An investor interested in the Celo ecosystem can use this project to research and better understand the various projects within the ecosystem. They can access information directly from the project owners, giving them a better understanding of the projects' objectives and development status.

In summary, Awesome Celo will serve the mission of Celo by bringing together most stakeholders of the ecosystem and creating a platform that tries to act as a social hub and aims to constantly include up-to-date information.

# WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO WITH THIS GRANT? WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL FOR THE PROJECT YOU'D LIKE TO BUILD/EXECUTE? EXPLAIN HERE WHAT YOU NEED THESE FUNDS FOR, PLEASE NOTE PROJECTS SHOULD NO LONGER THAN 6 MONTHS

The Celo ecosystem has grown tremendously over time, yet it lacks a centralized platform for showcasing the projects developed on it except static Celo dApps page. Existing resources are scattered across different websites, making it challenging for project owners to keep their information up-to-date. To tackle this problem, I have created a new platform called "Awesome Celo." This platform acts as a social hub for all Celo based projects, providing a centralized location for project owners to showcase their work and manage their information. Through Awesome Celo, project owners have complete control over how their project is presented on the platform and can engage with a community of peers who share similar interests. 

The development of Awesome Celo is an extensive project that involves a comprehensive and scalable backend design, as well as intensive frontend development. To accomplish these tasks, I am seeking a grant to support the completion of the work detailed in the milestones section of my proposal. This grant will allow me to dedicate the necessary resources to ensure that the project is completed to the highest standards.

In addition to development, the grant will also support one year of maintenance, ensuring that the platform remains fully functional and up-to-date. This maintenance period will include ongoing updates, bug fixes, and security patches to ensure that the platform continues to meet the needs of the Celo community.

Overall, the grant will enable me to build a robust and reliable platform that serves as a hub for the entire Celo ecosystem. With the support of the grant, I am confident that I can deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of both project owners and the wider community. Awesome Celo will be delivered in 3 months with project owner, admin dashboards and a public interface with all its functionality.

Some Functionality

# HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE NEED YOUR PRODUCT

1 - Currently, there is no centralized platform for the Celo community to showcase their projects beyond the official Celo docs page. Awesome Celo can fill this gap by providing a platform where project owners can showcase their work to a wider audience.

2 - With Awesome Celo, project owners can have more control over their content, making it easier to manage updates and communicate project details to the community.

3 - Unlike the official Celo docs page, Awesome Celo offers enhanced modules that can help project owners better explain their projects to the community, making it easier for people to understand the value of their work like github activity, token stats, job postings and so on.

4 - Other blockchain communities, such as Near, Polkadot, and Polkadot, already have similar showcase platforms. As the Celo community continues to grow, there will be an increasing need for a platform like Awesome Celo to support the ecosystem.

The Celo community needs a centralized platform like Awesome Celo that provides a comprehensive overview of all the projects in the ecosystem, making it easier for people to discover new projects and engage with the community.

# OBJECTIVE FOR THIS FUNDING, WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS FUNDING, BE SPECIFIC AND CONCISE. THINK SMART (SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ACHIEVABLE, RELEVANT AND TIME BOUND)

I want to build a all in one platform for Celo ecosystem which project owners and ecosystem partners came together and supply up-to-date information to community in three main sections:
  
  - Section 1: Community
    - Home Page
    - Projects Page
    - Project Detail Page (6 Modules)
    - Articles Page
    - Article Detail Page
    - Ranking Page
    - Learn Page

  - Section 2: Project Owners
    - Stats Page
    - Project Page (6 Modules)
    - Article Page 
  
  - Section 3: Ecosystem Partners (Admins)
    - Stats Page
    - Projects Page
    - User Page

Section 1 of Awesome Celo serves as the public-facing showcase platform for the entire Celo community. On this platform, all project owners can showcase their work and engage with the wider Celo ecosystem, providing an accessible hub for everyone interested in the platform.

Sections 2 and 3, on the other hand, are designed as a private portal accessible only to authorized users. These sections offer enhanced functionality and enable project owners to have complete control over their content. This includes a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the relevant features, ensuring that project owners can effectively manage their updates and other project-related activities.

With Awesome Celo's Section 2 and 3, project owners have access to a comprehensive suite of tools to help them effectively communicate their project's value to the Celo community. Whether it's updating project information, sharing Github activities, or posting articles, the private portal provides all the necessary functionality in a secure, easy-to-use, and highly customizable environment.
